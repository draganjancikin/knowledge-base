## What is SSH?

Secure Shell is a protocol which allows you to connect securely to a remote computer by using a text-based interface.

When a secure SSH connection is established, a shell session will be started, and you will be able to manipulate the server by typing commands within the client on your local computer.

You need SSH client.

```bash
# Check if SSH client instaled on your computer
$ ssh
# If the client is installed, you will receive a response that looks like this:
usage: ssh [-1246AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec]
[-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file] [-e escape_char] ...
```
